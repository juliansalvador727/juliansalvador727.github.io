        How can someone be an Algorithmic Engineer working in Meta or TikTok
        that creates addictive, non-Catholic scrolling algorithms while holding
        a Catholic worldview?

        Working as an algorithmic engineer at companies like Meta or TikTok
        presents a moral dilemma for Catholics, especially when their work
        contributes to designing algorithms that encourage addictive scrolling
        behavior. These systems are often optimized not for the wellbeing of the
        user but for maximizing time on platforms for the sake of advertisement
        revenue and engagement at the expense of the user’s mental health and
        attention span. According to a study by M. Faverio and O. Sidoti [1]
        “roughly half of teenagers say they go on Instagram or Snapchat every
        day” with “six-in-ten visit[ing] TikTok daily.” From a Catholic
        worldview, this raises the question: how can one balance working on
        these algorithms while holding Catholic principles in human dignity and
        moral responsibility?

        Pope John Paul II’s <i>Centesimus Annus</i> reminds us that economic and
        technological systems must always prioritize the dignity of the person,
        and therefore the dignity of work. In <i>Chapter V. State and Culture</i>, he
        emphasizes the importance of fostering a moral environment that supports
        the development of individuals and children. He [2, Point 47] writes of
        them to grow “in a moral environment conducive to the growth of the
        child's personality; the right to develop one's intelligence and freedom
        in seeking and knowing the truth”. This call to uphold morality stands
        in stark contrast to digital environments designed to capture attention
        rather than promote truth or personal growth. When algorithms manipulate
        users toward endless scrolling or consumption, they violate this
        principle by treating the person as a product. For Catholic Engineers,
        this teaching challenges them to build systems that support people
        rather than seeking engagement metrics or revenue.

      <p>
        In <i>Laborem Exercens</i>, also by Pope John Paul II, he adds to the dignity
        of human labor by expressing that work is a share in the activity of the
        Creator. In <i>Chapter V. Elements for A Spirituality of Work</i>, John Paul II
        [3, Point 25] refers to the Book of Genesis as the “first gospel of
        work”. He adds that “man ought to imitate God, his Creator, in working,
        because man alone has the unique characteristic of likeness to God.”
        Because humans are created in the image and likeness of God, work
        becomes not only a necessity but a calling and active way to participate
        in God’s ongoing creation. This view elevates the moral responsibility
        of all workers to ensure that labor upholds human dignity rather than
        undermining it through exploitation.

        Ultimately, a Catholic algorithmic engineer at companies like Meta or
        TikTok must decide on whether their contributions serve the dignity of
        human labor and the dignity of individuals. Pope John Paul II’s
        encyclicals <i>Centesimus Annus</i> and <i>Laborem Exercens</i> provide a clear
        Catholic perspective that work must not reduce a person to a means of
        capital, and neither should technology undermine the truth or growth. If
        algorithms are designed to manipulate rather than uplift, then Catholic
        algorithmic engineers face a serious ethical responsibility to reform
        these systems or work in a different role that aligns to their values.
        Upholding the dignity of the human person is becoming increasingly more
        important in a digitalized world with new, foreign technologies, and
        Catholic algorithmic engineers at the forefront with these technologies
        should consider the values of the Church and prioritize the dignity of
        others.
